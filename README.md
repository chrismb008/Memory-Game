## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to play

1. Download/clone this repo: https://github.com/chrismb008/Memory-Game.git
2. Launch the index file in the browser
3. The goal is to match all 8 pairs of cards as quickly as possible. The game begins when a card is clicked. Once all pairs are turned over, the game ends, displaying your score.
